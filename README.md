# IOTFireDetection

This project was inspired by the constant wildfires from california and the australian bush fires. it is a wildfire detection system using a mesh network.
the network is composed of a particle argon microcontroller as the main node and multiple particle xenon micro controllers as secondary nodes. 
Any number of xenons can be added to the network in one of two varieties, thermocouple or temp & humidity sensor.
In the future I would like to update ths project to use LoRa as a comunication medium instead of particle cloud.
